My old README was boring, so the new one is on its way.

In the meantime:
- Twitter: <a href = "https://twitter.com/stepan__nazarov" target = "_blank">@stepan__nazarov</a>
    - My main focus at the moment; I code up various things and talk about them.
- Instagram: <a href = "https://instagram.com/stepan._.nazarov" target = "_blank">@stepan._.nazarov</a>
    - I'm tall here
- Telegram: <a href = "https://t.me/suslike" target = "_blank">@Suslike</a>
    - If you're into privacy, I suppose
- VK: <a href = "https://vk.com/knight_of_the_square_table" target = "_blank">@knight_of_the_square_table</a>
    - If anyone's Russian and feels like texting me there (rarely checked)
